      <h2>The Island of Goodbyes</h2>
      <img class='img-150 img-left' src='assets/photos/7I1A2270.jpg'></img>
      <p>The night before her two week stint handing out food to refugees ended, a volunteer from the Netherlands reflected sadly, "Lesvos is the Island of goodbyes."</p>
      <p>Refugees stay only a few days, and volunteers perhaps a few weeks.  They are drawn together into a human drama unlike any seen since World War II.</p>
      <p>According to the UN, the movement of people from the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia into Europe is the largest refugee crisis since 1950 when the UNHCR was created.  They are fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, threats in countries like Pakistan and Egypt, and economic hardship and lack of opportunity in Algeria, Morocco, Somalia and Mali.</p>
      <p>The numbers are staggering. In January 2016 alone, 50,000 refugees and migrants came ashore on the Greek islands in the Aegean closest to Turkey, more than ten times the number in January 2015.</p>
      <p>By the end of February that number climbed to over 120,000.  The majority arrive on the small island of Lesvos, others on the the islands of Chios, Samos, Agathonisi, Leros and Kos.  Lesvos has become the gateway to Europe, and in the words of one Greenpeace activist on the island, it is fast becoming the frontline of fortress Europe.</p>

        <p>There are over eighty aid organizations helping refugees on Lesvos, including UNHCR and the International Rescue Committee, who operate refugee camps.  Many are small organizations staffed by hundreds of volunteers from all over the world.  They play a crucial role in assisting refugees, particularly as the refugees arrive by boat on Lesvos.  There are restrictions on what the larger organization can do, which is where the individuals come in.  The UNHCR is not able to help refugees on the beach, or take them to ferries, as that would be considered assisting in the forward movement of illegal immigrants, i.e. human trafficking.</p>

        Organizations with the capability to perform sea rescues - Green Peace, ProEmAid and Proactiva from Spain and Sea Watch from Germany - equipped with high speed boats, operate in Greek waters north of the island in a delicate dance with the Hellenic Coast Guard and Frontex, the pan-European border agency.

        <h3>Romeo</h3>
        <p>Spotters on mountain tops call in boat sightings from a radio relay code named "Romeo."</p>
        <p>
          But the pressure is on to stop the tide of refugees and migrants, and the volunteers are feeling it.  Most rescue boats have not been given permission to operate on the south of the island, where the majority of refugee are landing now.  "Romeo" was shut down in January by Greek authorities, but quickly replaced by "Juliet."  All NGOs on the island are now required to register with local officials.  Seven volunteers were arrested in January and later released for taking life vests from a dump to use as bedding for refugees.  A week later three Spanish lifeguards and two volunteers from Denmark were arrested and held for two days, charged with human trafficking when they went on a private boat to assist a refugee boat in distress. The three Spanish lifeguards from the organization ProEmAid were released with a $15,000 fine, after a lengthy court appearance at the Palace of Justice, played out in front of a gathering of volunteer supporters and media who waited fourteen hours in the courtyard below.  (The Spanish team were allowed to leave Greece, but their case is still pending. The owner of the boat, from the Netherlands, was also released with a fine, but may not leave the country for two years.)

        <h3>The WhatsApp Migration</h3>
        <p>If the Arab Spring was the Facebook revolution, we are now looking at a WhatsApp migration.  WhatsApp is the messaging platform of choice for volunteers and refugees alike, who communicate in various ad hoc groups. Volunteers across the island coordinate boat sightings, and refugees send their location in real-time to friends and volunteers waiting onshore as they make the crossing in hopes they will be met when they arrive, or that they can be rescued if their boats start to sink.</p>

      <h3>The Route of Death</h3>
      <img class='img-left img-150'src='assets/photos/570A9157.jpg'/>
      <p>The crossing between the Turkish coast and the Greek islands is known to Syrians making the perilous journey as the the "route of death," &#1591;&#1585;&#1610;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1608;&#1578;, tareeq al moot, or alternately "boat of death."  Refugees and migrants pay on average $1000 per person to get on rubber dinghies stuffed with as many as sixty people on treacherous waters in sub freezing conditions.  The smugglers make a refugee drive the boat.  Often there isn't enough fuel to make it out of Turkish waters, or the drivers guns the engine and the motor burns out.</p>
      <p>"You can imagine what the options are if someone is willing do risk their life in this way," says Boris Cheshirkov, spokesperson for UNHCR in Lesvos, while standing on a bluff overlooking a beach where rubber rafts arrive in freezing rain and high winds.</p>
      <p>A scene all the more poignant since you can take a safe, fast ferry from Lesvos to Turkey for as little as ten Euros.  From his office overlooking the harbor in Mitilini, the mayor of Lesvos told us he had proposed a plan with the mayor of Izmir in Turkey to provide a ferry for the refugees, but the Turkish government wouldn't allow it.</p>

      <p>The boats arrive day and night in a continuous cycle.  Volunteers race up and down the beach spotting boats with binoculars, waving thermal blankets and bright orange life vests to guide the boats away from the rocks to a safe landing spot on the beach.  At night, they shine flashlights on the water, trying to guide boats, looking for the faint light of cell phones from refugee out on the dark seas.</p>
      <p>As a boat approaches, rescuers in wet suits wade into the water to pull the boat in, shouting "slowly, slowly" in Arabic.  Volunteers grab the children first, helping off the rest off one by one.  Some refugees kiss the ground, some pray, some try to call relatives on cell phones wrapped in plastic for the journey, others yell "thank you UN, thank you Europe!" when they see our camera.</p>
      <p>But most just stand shivering in the wind, drenched from the three to four hour journey, unsure of what is next.</p>
      <img class='img-left img-150'src='assets/photos/570A9412.jpg'/>
      <p>As quickly as they are offloaded, the boat is dismantled by locals, the plastic is deflated and left like a carcass on the shore, the engine and wood is removed and scurried away.  Rumors abound that the engines go back to Turkey, closing the circle on smuggling.  But with Greece's struggling economy, it is just as believable that they are simply sold for money.  Across the beach, at least one small farm had used the remains of a dingy as the covering for a sheep pen.</p>
      <p>With 856,723 arrivals by sea in 2015, smuggling along the route of death is a billion dollar industry.  A shady business replete with fake life jackets, armed men on jet skis who board the rubber boats in the dead of night to steal the motors and the valuables of refugees, and even first hand reports of Turkish Coast Guard boats ramming and puncturing the rubber boats to stop the refugees.</p>
      <p> One Syrian family we met on the beach had tried six times to cross, each time they were turned back by the Turkish authorities.  On the seventh time, they made it.</p>
      <p>Over the fall, during the peak of the crossings, most refugees landed on Skala beach on the north of Lesvos.  Since December, many more are landing along the beaches just south of the main city of Mitilini.  No one is quite sure why, perhaps the winter currents and weather patterns, perhaps the reports of increased Turkish patrols in the north.</p>
      <p>Those that make it to shore are greeted by a gathering of NGO workers and volunteers who quickly wrap them in silver and gold thermal blankets, give them dry cloths, then they are ushered onto UNHCR buses to go to Moria refugee center.  It is a much smoother operation than at the height of the crisis in the fall, when there we few volunteers and no buses.</p>
      <img class='img-right img-150'src='assets/photos/7I1A1066.jpg'/>
      <p>Moria was built as a detention facility, and still looks like a prison, with chain link fencing topped with barbed wire.  But the camp has grown beyond the confines of the steel gates, with makeshift tents dotting the olive hills to the north, known as Afghan hill.</p>
      <p>When refugees arrive in Moria, they are taken to a registration area run by Frontex. Registration involves verifying the country a refugee comes from.  Frontex doesn't have the authority to process personal information, so no attempt is made to identify individuals.  Many arrive without papers anyway.  As refugees flee the fighting, there is often no time to grab documents.  Documents, cell phones, passports often disappear en route, stolen by thieves or smugglers, taken by border police, or lost in the sea.  Of those that do have papers, approximately ten percent are forged documents, usually fake Syrian passports, according to Frontex.</p>
      <p>Once country of origin is determined, Greek authorities issue temporary papers.  Refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are given transit papers allowing three months in Greece, refugees from other countries are given one month.</p>
      <p>Most refugees say the same thing when asked where they are headed; Germany.  But others aim for Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, wherever they have personal connections.  Refugees from North Africa and Pakistan, some who have been there for weeks, ask for our help, unaware that they will likely be deported.</p>
      <p>A humanitarian crisis is looming now at the next stop along the journey. At the Greek border with Macedonia, Afghan refugees are now being stopped.  Macedonia has changed its policy, classifying Afghans as economic migrants, not refugees.</p>
      <p>With ever increasing numbers of refugees and migrants arriving on Lesbos every day, there is no end in site for this crisis.</p>
